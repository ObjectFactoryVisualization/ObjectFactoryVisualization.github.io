# Object Factory Visualization

Welcome to object factory visualization!

This project presents an interactive visualization of the execution context related to object productions. Our visualization augments the traditional calling-context tree with visual cues to characterize object factory contexts.

Our [ paper ](./main.pdf) is available to read.
